# Lesson 01: Introduction to Python - Quiz Preparation Guide

## üìö Lesson Overview
This lesson covers the fundamentals of Python programming language, its history, features, and basic setup.

## üéØ Key Concepts to Master

### 1. What is Python?
- **Definition**: Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language
- **Creator**: Guido van Rossum (created in 1991)
- **Philosophy**: "Simple is better than complex" (The Zen of Python)

### 2. Python Features
- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line by line
- **High-level**: Closer to human language than machine language
- **General-purpose**: Can be used for various applications
- **Object-oriented**: Supports OOP principles
- **Dynamic typing**: Variable types are determined at runtime
- **Automatic memory management**: Garbage collection

### 3. Python Versions
- **Python 2**: Legacy version (discontinued in 2020)
- **Python 3**: Current stable version (recommended)
- **Key differences**: Print statement, division, string handling

### 4. Python Applications
- Web Development (Django, Flask)
- Data Science & AI (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow)
- Automation & Scripting
- Game Development
- Desktop Applications
- Scientific Computing

### 5. Python Philosophy
- **The Zen of Python**: 19 guiding principles
- **Readability**: Code should be easy to read
- **Simplicity**: Simple is better than complex
- **Explicit**: Explicit is better than implicit

## üìù Sample MCQs with Detailed Explanations

### Question 1: Python Creator
**Who created the Python programming language?**

- A) Dennis Ritchie
- B) Guido van Rossum ‚úÖ
- C) James Gosling
- D) Bjarne Stroustrup

**Explanation**: Guido van Rossum created Python in 1991 while working at CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) in the Netherlands. He named it after Monty Python's Flying Circus.

### Question 2: Python Characteristics
**Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of Python?**

- A) Interpreted language
- B) High-level language
- C) Compiled language ‚úÖ
- D) General-purpose language

**Explanation**: Python is an interpreted language, not compiled. The interpreter reads and executes code line by line, while compiled languages are converted to machine code before execution.

### Question 3: Python Version
**What is the current stable version of Python?**

- A) Python 2.7
- B) Python 3.x ‚úÖ
- C) Python 4.0
- D) Python 1.0

**Explanation**: Python 3.x is the current stable version. Python 2 was discontinued in 2020, and Python 4.0 hasn't been released yet.

### Question 4: Language Type
**Which statement best describes Python?**

- A) A compiled programming language
- B) An interpreted, high-level programming language ‚úÖ
- C) A markup language
- D) A database language

**Explanation**: Python is both interpreted (executed line by line) and high-level (closer to human language than machine code).

### Question 5: Zen of Python
**What does "The Zen of Python" refer to?**

- A) A Python framework
- B) A collection of guiding principles for Python ‚úÖ
- C) A Python library
- D) A Python IDE

**Explanation**: The Zen of Python contains 19 aphorisms that serve as guiding principles for writing Python code. You can view it by typing `import this` in Python.

## üîç Additional Practice Questions

### Question 6: Python Execution
**How is Python code typically executed?**

- A) Compiled to machine code first
- B) Interpreted line by line ‚úÖ
- C) Transpiled to JavaScript
- D) Compiled to bytecode only

### Question 7: Python Applications
**Which of the following is NOT a common application of Python?**

- A) Web development
- B) Data science
- C) Operating system development ‚úÖ
- D) Automation scripting

### Question 8: Python Philosophy
**What is the first principle of The Zen of Python?**

- A) Simple is better than complex
- B) Beautiful is better than ugly ‚úÖ
- C) Readability counts
- D) Explicit is better than implicit

### Question 9: Python Features
**Which feature allows Python to automatically manage memory?**

- A) Dynamic typing
- B) Garbage collection ‚úÖ
- C) Interpreted execution
- D) Object-oriented programming

### Question 10: Python History
**In which year was Python first released?**

- A) 1989
- B) 1990
- C) 1991 ‚úÖ
- D) 1992
